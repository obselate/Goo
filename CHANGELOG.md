# Changelog

## 0.2.0 - Unreleased

### Changed

- SkiaSharp and SkiaSharp.HarfBuzz upgraded from 3.116.0 to 4.151.1, moving
  Skia from m116 to m151.
- HarfBuzzSharp and HarfBuzzSharp.NativeAssets.Linux upgraded from 8.3.1.1 to
  14.2.1.2, moving HarfBuzz from 8.3.1 to 14.2.1.
- Removed the SkiaSharp 3.x duplicate Linux native alias cleanup from
  `Goo.targets`; SkiaSharp 4.x ships a single canonical `libSkiaSharp.so`.
- Internal path construction migrated from the deprecated mutable `SKPath`
  API to `SKPathBuilder`, ahead of SkiaSharp removing its compatibility
  shim. Uniform solid borders and inset box shadows now paint through
  `SKCanvas.DrawRoundRectDifference`, making rounded solid borders about
  3x faster and removing the shim's per-paint allocation overhead. Public
  API is unchanged.
